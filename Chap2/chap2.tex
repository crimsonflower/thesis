\section{The Standard Model}
\label{SM}
\subsection{The overview of the Standard Model}
The underlying theory of modern High Energy Physics is the Standard Model (SM). This theory has been developed in the second half of the 20th century with contributions from many scientists and it is a very successful representation of the world on the subatomic level.
The SM classifies all known subatomic particles into specific categories and provides the description of the interactions between them. 

In the SM there are two main types of fermions (1/2-spin particles) known as quarks and leptons. Each family has three generations with each consecutive generation being heavier than the previous. The up and down quarks along with the electron are stable and constitute ordinary matter. The interactions between fermions are mediated through the exchange of force carrier particles known as gauge bosons (see Tab.~\ref{tab:SM}). The final piece in the SM is the Higgs boson and it gives mass to other fundamental particles. All bosons possess integer spin \citep{martin2006nuclear}. Further nomenclature identifies hadrons - composite particles that are made of quarks and gluons.

The mathematical representation of the SM is built within the broader frame of Group Theory. Employing the official terminology, the SM has the symmetry group U(1)$_{\text{Y}}\times$SU(2)$_{\text{L}}\times$SU(3). The SU(3) symmetry group generates strong interactions, that describe processes involving quarks and gluons. These processes are described by the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics and the particles possess a specific type of charge known as ``colour charge".
The U(1)$_{\text{Y}}\times$SU(2)$_{\text{L}}$ group generates electroweak interactions. At energies below 100 GeV, however, the single electroweak interaction is broken into the weak and electromagnetic varieties with the symmetry group U(1)$_{\text{em}}$. 
The unification of these two types was the result of efforts by Glashow, Weinberg and Salam \citep{Glashow:1961tr,weinberg1967model,salam1968elementary}. 
The weak interaction processes involve fermions and are mediated by electrically charged W\textsuperscript{$\pm$} bosons for charged processes and the chargeless Z gauge boson for neutral ones. Finally, the electromagnetic force is mediated by photons and only involves electrically charged particles. 

Above the unification energy of 100 GeV, and thus before the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking  through Higgs mechanism \citep{englert1964broken, higgs1964broken}, the gauge bosons are different. There are three W bosons, denoted W\textsuperscript{1}, W\textsuperscript{2}, W\textsuperscript{3} corresponding to the SU(2)$_{\text{L}}$ part of the group and one B boson corresponding to the U(1)$_{\text{Y}}$ part. 
All the electroweak bosons are massless, and acquire mass by coupling to the Higgs field in the process of symmetry breaking.  

\subsection{Limitations of the SM}

The predictions of the SM have been successfully tested in particle accelerator experiments, and its final confirmation came with the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 - a true scientific breakthrough. This was the last missing piece of experimental evidence needed for the full validation of the SM. The experiments that led to this discovery were conducted at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in run-I proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=$7 and the later upgrade to 8 TeV.  
Despite the fact that the SM has proven to be an extremely precise and successful theory there are some caveats for which it does not provide  adequate solutions. 

One of the inconsistencies within the SM is the so-called Hierarchy problem \citep{PhysRevD.14.1667}. One of the ways it reveals itself is through the large discrepancy between the Planck mass and the mass of the Higgs particle. The former is about $10^{17}$ times bigger than the latter and current representation of particle physics cannot explain such a big difference. Quantum effects start manifesting themselves at the Plank mass threshold and such a vast difference between these two values is yet unaccounted for. 

Another prominent problem is that the SM does not explain dark matter. While ordinary matter only constitutes about 5\% in the total mass-energy content of the universe, it is dark matter and dark energy that account for the rest \citep{ade2014planck}. 
%However,
The SM does not provide a candidate particle for dark matter and thus is only able to describe ordinary matter and energy. 

One of the main challenges of modern physics is the unification of forces. This is part of the ongoing attempts to reach the ultimate goal - a ``theory of everything". Such a theory would have to account for all physical aspects of the universe and include the most fundamental structures and interactions. The first step was made with the unification of electromagnetic and weak forces.  
The next step is to achieve the unification of electromagnetic, weak, and strong interaction forces – this step is the Grand Unification. The ultimate step is to combine all four fundamental forces together, which means adding gravity, in what is called Super Unification (see Fig.~\ref{fig:unification}). Thus far quantum field theory and general relativity are able to describe phenomena on their respective scale of action with remarkable precision, but are fundamentally incompatible.

\caption[Unification of forces]{\label{fig:unification} Various stages in the unification of forces  \citep{unification}}.
\end{figure}

Within the confines of the SM even the Grand Unification is not possible, and this prompts the search for new theories that account for this and other shortcomings of the SM. Collectively they are called Beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) theories. Among these, there are theories that include extra-dimensions, composite Higgs boson models, etc. Theoretical and experimental search for BSM physics is the current frontier of HEP and one of the most important questions in science overall. 


\section{Supersymmetry}
One of the strongest candidate framework theories that can offer solutions to the SM deficiencies is supersymmetry (SUSY) \citep{Lykken:1996xt}. SUSY is a spacetime symmetry that equates fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom. Among several theories that are based on SUSY principles, the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) offers the simplest extention of the SM. The MSSM postulates that each SM particle has a supersymmetric partner which is  different only in spin by one-half unit %(see Table~\ref{tab:MSSMparticles}), 
while all other quantum numbers stay the same.

%\end{table}
The superpartners of quarks, leptons, and neutrinos are called squarks, sleptons and sneutrinos. For gauge bosons the superpartners are  gluinos, photino, winos and binos, collectively named gauginos. The latter two are superpartners of the  B and three W bosons of the elecroweak interaction before electroweak symmetry breaking. It follows naturally since SUSY is invoked before the electroweak symmetry breaking. The Higgs sector in SUSY has five superpartners  - two charged $(H^{\pm})$ particles and three neutral ones $(h^0, H^0, A^0)$. They are known collectively as Higgsinos. Mixing between winos, binos and Higgsinos results in charginos and neutralinos. Their mass eigenstates are referred to as $\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{i}$ ($i$ = 1,2) and $\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{i}$ ($i$ = 1,2,3,4) in order fo increasing mass. 

The MSSM belongs to a class of theories that all share the same requirement - a quantity known as R-parity has to be conserved in interactions. The mathematical description of R-parity is beyond the scope of this paper. However, one important consequence of R-parity conservation is that if supersymmetric particles were to be produced in collisions, they would be created in pairs. Then they decay through various possible scenarios with the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) emerging in the final state and escaping undetected. Because the LSP is stable it provides a possible candidate for the dark matter particle.

The MSSM imposes 105 free parameters and this is one of its major issues, since any analysis will be addled with enormous complexity stemming from high dimensionality. There are various simplified models that reduce the number of free parameters to manageable values through various theoretically and experimentally motivated constraints. One of them is the phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (pMSSM) that contains only 19 free parameters and which will be used in this thesis' analysis. 





\section{The ATLAS detector}
\label{sec:atlas}
The ATLAS experiment is a multi-purpose particle detector with cylindrical geometry and has a nominal forward-backward symmetry \citep{aad2008atlas}. The dimensions of the detector are 25 m in height and 44 m in length and the overall weight of the detector is approximately 7000 tonnes.
It can detect particles with almost 4$\pi$ coverage in solid angle around the collision point, which covers almost all of the spherical area around the center. 

Proton bunches are accelerated in the underground ring that is 27 km in diameter and are directed to collide inside the detectors. The collisions happen at 40 MHz bunch crossing rate, with an average 23 interactions per bunch crossing. The LHC is designed to operate at $\sqrt{s}$=14 TeV and instantaneous luminosity $\mathcal{L} = 10^{34}$ cm\textsuperscript{-2} s\textsuperscript{-1} in proton-proton collision mode. Instantaneous luminosity is defined as follows
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{\sigma}\frac{dN}{dt}
\end{equation}  
Where $\sigma$ is the interaction cross-section, and $N$ is the number of detected events during time $t$. Integrated luminosity $\int \mathcal{L}\, dt$ is a quantity that expresses the amount of total data gathered during the time $t$ of running the LHC. Luminosity  is particularly useful as a way to express the amount of data gathered, because it allows to find number of events for a particular process simply by multiplying this process's cross-section by the value of luminosity. The analysis presented in this paper uses the dataset recorded at 3.2 fb\textsuperscript{-1} of integrated luminosity throughout run-II of the LHC during 2015. 

%Add something about cross sections!!!!!!

\end{figure}

The Cartesian coordinate system used at ATLAS has its origin at the nominal point of interaction with the $z$ axis extending along the particle beam longitudinally, the positive $x$ axis pointing towards the center of the ring, and the positive $y$ axis pointing upwards. 
The geometry of the detector makes the use of cylindrical coordinate system especially convenient. Using it, the $z$ axis stays the same, the polar angle $\theta$ is the angle from the $z$-axis, and the azimuthal angle $\phi$ encircles the $z$ axis in the transverse plane. However, instead of $\theta$ it is more convenient to use pseudorapidity $\eta$, due to the fact that differences in pseudorapidity are close to invariant under Lorentz boosts along the $z$ axis (fully invariant for real rapidity). $\eta$ is defined as follows
\begin{equation}
\eta = -\ln\biggl(\tan\frac{\theta}{2}\biggr)
\end{equation}


\subsection{ The ATLAS sub-detectors and trigger systems}

The ATLAS detector consists of several subdetector layers with each layer performing a specific function (see Fig.~\ref{fig:event}). The Inner Detector (ID) performs tracking of newly created particles. It is closest to the collision point and covers $|\eta|<2.5$ in pseudorapidity. The ID has high granularity as it is exposed to the highest density of particle interaction. It was designed to provide a transverse momentum resolution and a transverse impact parameter resolution \citep{aad2010atlas}. The detector itself consists of three separate subsystems. The main components of the ID are the silicon pixel detector, the semiconductor tracker, and the transition radiation tracker. Ahead of the run-II a new pixel layer, called the Insertable B-Layer (IBL), has been added to the ID improving the resolution and particle identification qualities. All these layers are immersed in a 2 T magnetic field, created by the thin superconducting solenoidal magnet. This field is parallel to the beam axis and bends trajectories of charged particles allowing their charge and momentum identification based on the characteristic bending of their trajectories.

\end{figure}

The next two layers are the two calorimeters that measure energies of specific types of particles. The particles travel through the detectors and lose their energy via interaction with its layers leaving energy deposits as they move through the material. 
The first one is the high-granularity Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EmCal) and it measures energies of electrons and photons. Coloured particles (gluons and quarks) form ``jets" that travel further into Hadronic calorimeter (HCal) where they continue their decays and also deposit their available energy.
Both calorimeters are  designed to provide good quality measurements of momentum and energy and cover the region $|\eta|<4.9$.

The final detecting layer is the Muon spectrometer (MS), which tracks and measures charged particles, specifically muons. Muons do not interact with matter as strongly as electrons so they travel further without radiating much energy in the calorimeters. The MS is immersed into a large toroidal magnet, that provides a magnetic field throughout the spectrometer and bends the trajectories of charged muons, which makes it possible to detect their charge and momentum. Any particles that are not covered by the described sub-detectors will escape undetected. These include neutrinos and, possibly, the LSP. 

Triggers are used to select events by identifying signatures of various particles as well as using global event signatures, such as missing transverse energy \citep{aad2012performance}. A multilevel trigger system is used at ATLAS to select events that are of interest to further offline analysis. 
The  first  level is hardware-based and uses information from the calorimeters and muon spectrometer, the second and third levels are software-based and use information from all sub-detectors. Because the data at the LHC is produced in staggering amounts employing efficient trigger systems is crucial to be able to extract information that is relevant for further analysis. At $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV the spacing between bunches crossing is 25 ns and the collision rate is 40 MHz. This rate has to be reduced to O(500 Hz) to be able to keep data in permanent memory devices \citep{barr2015particle}.

Ideally, a trigger should be able to retain a maximum number of events that are interesting for physics analysis and reject as many background events as possible. In this regard the concept of trigger efficiency is very important, and this efficiency varies depending on the particular process that is being investigated. The overall goal is to reduce data from the raw amount to the size at which it can be stored permanently and at the same time keeping  as many relevant events as possible.
