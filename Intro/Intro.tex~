High Energy Physics (HEP) is a branch of Physics that studies elementary particles using information obtained with particle accelerators. The largest currently functioning HEP experiment is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Geneva. It accelerates protons and creates collisions at a centre-of-mass energy up to 13 TeV (since 2015). These collisions happen at two cites where main particle detectors are situated. These experiments are ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus) and CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid). Such high energy conditions of collisions emulate the state of the universe very shortly after the Big Bang and thus allow creation of particles that don't exist at normal conditions. 
The underlying theory of modern HEP is the Standard Model and it has been very successful in describing subatomic particles and the interactions between them. It is a very robust theory that has been proved correct through a plethora of experiments at colliders. The most prominent success of previous LHC runs at 7 and 8 TeV centre-of-mass energy was the discovery of the Higgs particle, which 
was the final SM particle to be discovered experimentally.  
However, there are limitations to SM and there is a number of theories that try address these shortcomings. Collectively they are known as “Beyond-the-Standard-Model” (BSM) theories. One of the more popular BSM theories is Supersymmetry, as it has a mathematically effective and elegant representation and, most importantly, overcomes some critical SM limitations.
Searches for supersymmetry evidence are performed at LHC along with other particle experiments. After runs at 7 and 8 TeV no evidence was found, but higher energy collisions provide a better chance of finding evidence of BSM theories. The research presented in this paper focuses on trying to develop a search method for potential supersymmetric particles.
